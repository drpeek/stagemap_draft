\section{Conclusion}
\label{section:conclusion}

In this paper, we present a novel visual analytics approach to visualize event sequence data. First, we propose an information-theoretic method based on the minimum description length principle to construct an overview of data. This method can extract sequential patterns and cluster event sequences simultaneously. We further demonstrate that it supports soft pattern matching and it is a generic approach that can incorporate different editing operations. We then propose a comprehensive visual analytics system with multiple levels-of-detail to facilitate interactive data exploration. We also conduct case studies with two real-world dataset and collect feedback from end users to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. We also introduce a new application domain for event sequence visualization, which is  fault development path analysis for predictive diagnostics in vehicles. \looseness=-1
