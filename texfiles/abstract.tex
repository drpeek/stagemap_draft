Temporal event sequences are becoming increasingly important in many application domains such as website click streams, user interaction logs, electronic health records and car service records. A real-world dataset with a large number of event sequences and of varying sequence lengths is complex and difficult to analyze. To support visual exploration of the data, it is desirable yet challenging to provide a concise and meaningful overview of sequences. In this paper, we focus on the stage, that is, frequently occurring subsequences, which is common in event sequence datasets and carries high level semantics in the data. We present a novel visualization technique to summarize event sequence data into a set of stage progression patterns. The resulting overview is more concise compared with event-level summarization and supports level-of-detail exploration. We further introduce StageMap, a visual analytics system with three linked views to visualize the stage-level overview, the event-level patterns and the detailed individual sequences. We also present case studies where the system is used in two different domains and discuss advantages and limitations of applying StageMap to various application scenarios.
